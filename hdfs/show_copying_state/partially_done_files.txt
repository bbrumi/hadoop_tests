# In one terminal start to generate random strings and put this in a file on HDFS.

strings /dev/urandom | hdfs dfs -put - random.txt
# Do not close this terminal

# Navigate to your home directory on HDFS and show that there is a random.txt_COPYING_ file
# see that the size of the file is 0

$ hdfs dfs -du -h
0        random.txt._COPYING_

# After the demo stop the generation, otherwise we can fill up HDFS.

# Show that the size of the file changed
